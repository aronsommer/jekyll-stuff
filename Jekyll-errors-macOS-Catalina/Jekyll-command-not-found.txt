I had the same errors on macOS Catalina.

First make sure that the .bash_profile in your home directory includes this path:

(Show hidden files in Finder on Catalina: cmd + shift + fn + period)

export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH"

With macOS Catalina, Apple is now using Zsh as the default shell.

I solved the problem with switching the default shell to Bash.

Run this command in Terminal:

chsh -s /bin/bash
