1. Add the following to your project's Gemfile:  

gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins

2. Run bundle install

Note: You are not required to install Jekyll separately. Once the github-pages gem is installed, you can build your site using jekyll build, or preview your site using jekyll serve. For more information about installing Jekyll locally, please see the GitHub Help docs on the matter.
